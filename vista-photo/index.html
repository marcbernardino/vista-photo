            <p><q>I needed a videographer for my daughter’s quinceanera and a friend of
            mine recommended Caleb. I’m so glad they did, the video was exactly
            what I was hoping for. Thank you, Caleb!</q> - Mariana Freeks</p>

            <p><q>I needed graduation pictures for my daughter and I heard of Jessica
            through some friends. She answered all of my questions and was so
            patient! The pictures she took were what I was looking for. Will be
            recommending her to family and friends.</q> - Melvin Garcia</p>
